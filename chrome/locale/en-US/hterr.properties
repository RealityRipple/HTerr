error.420.title=HTTP Code 420
error.420.desc=FOUR TWENTY SMOKE WEED EVERY DAY
error.420.longDesc=<ul><li>In 1971, five high school students in San Rafael, California, used the term "4:20" in connection with a plan to search for an abandoned cannabis crop, based on a treasure map made by the grower. Calling themselves the Waldos, because their typical hang-out spot "was a wall outside the school", the five students (Steve Capper, Dave Reddix, Jeffrey Noel, Larry Schwartz, and Mark Gravich) designated the Louis Pasteur statue on the grounds of San Rafael High School as their meeting place, and 4:20 pm as their meeting time. The Waldos referred to this plan with the phrase "4:20 Louis". After several failed attempts to find the crop, the group eventually shortened their phrase to simply "4:20", which ultimately evolved into a code-word the teens used to refer to consuming cannabis.</li><li>Steven Hager of High Times was responsible for popularizing the story of the Waldos. The first High Times mention of 4:20 smoking and a 4/20 holiday appeared in May 1991, and the connection to the Waldos appeared in December 1998. Hager attributed the early spread of the phrase to Grateful Dead followers &mdash; after "Waldo" Reddix became a roadie for the Dead's bassist, Phil Lesh &mdash; and called for 4:20 pm to be the socially accepted hour of the day to consume cannabis.</li></ul>
